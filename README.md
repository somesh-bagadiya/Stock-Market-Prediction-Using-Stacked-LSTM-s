## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of Stock Market prediction using Stacked LSTMs

## Prerequisites

Understanding of RNNs and LSTMs. Hands-on with Sklearn and Keras library.

## Setup Instructions

Please make sure that Python is installed on your system, and also make sure to install the following libraries: numpy, pandas, keras, scikit-learn, and tensorflow.

## How to run

In the LSTM folder, you can find the code for the market prediction code. Make sure you download a CSV of your favorite stock from Yahoo Finance API and rename it as stock_price.csv
Note: This is a basic implementation feel free to adjust the parameters as you need it.
